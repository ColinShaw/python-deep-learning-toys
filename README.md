# Python Deep Learning Toys



This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks with interesting models, 
interesting techniques, etc., that may be of use to be able to refer
to in the future.  Nothing too exceptional, just fun projects 
that have a reason to be kept around.  

The general idea of these revolves around standard problems, like
MNIST classification, and ways of getting decent performance out
of the technique quickly.  Augmentation, small network structures,
etc.  I have a number of other deep learning repos that focus
on more interesting issues, like visualization of activition, 
training away noise, etc.
